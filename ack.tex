I would like to thank my advisor James Storer for the wonderful time I have had during my graduate years. He provided a perfect amount of supervision while letting me explore various areas of research that interested me.
I could not have asked for a better advisor.

I would like to thank Sadid Hasan (Philips Research), Raghuraman Krishnamoorthi (Facebook), Dinei Florencio (Microsoft) and Cha Zhang (Microsoft) who were my mentors during my summer internships and from whom I got to learn tremendously.  

I would like to acknowledge generous grants and donations by NVIDIA, Intel and Google, which made possible most of the research.

I am indebted to my friend Nick Moran who not only proofread all the papers that constitute this thesis but also served as a sounding board for all the ideas.

I would also like to thank Solomon Garber, Ryan Marcus and Antonella Di Lillo for various ideas and discussions throughtout my graduate years and for proof-reading all my papers.

Last but not least I would like to thank my parents Meena Karna and Vinay K Karna for always encouraging me to aim higher.
